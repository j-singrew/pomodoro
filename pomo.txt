Optional: pause(), resume(), or stop().

⌚ 4. Timing
Use std::this_thread::sleep_for and std::chrono::seconds to simulate a countdown.

🧪 5. Main Function
Create a PomodoroClock instance.

Call start() to begin the cycle.

✅ Optional Enhancements
Show countdown timer in real-time.

Add sound alerts or desktop notifications.

Build a GUI using a library (e.g. Qt, SFML).

Allow configuration via a settings file or user input.
